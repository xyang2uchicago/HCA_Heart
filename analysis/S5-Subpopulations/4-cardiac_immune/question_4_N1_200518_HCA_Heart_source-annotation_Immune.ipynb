# To reuse this dataset, I have downloaded the from https://www.heartcellatlas.org/ 
# On the page, I clicked the downloaded bottom at the bottom which is 
# https://cellgeni.cog.sanger.ac.uk/heartcellatlas/data/hca_heart_immune_download.h5ad

# My question is that I cannot generate a reasonably agreeable umap by following the code of
# https://github.com/cartal/HCA_Heart/blob/master/analysis/S5-Subpopulations/4-cardiac_immune/N1_200518_HCA_Heart_source-annotation_Immune.ipynb

# Following is my locally running code. 
# The line numbers below refer to the original lines in the N1_200518_HCA_Heart_source-annotation_Immune.ipynb
# My guess is that I have the wrong input file. Then where to find the correct input? 
# ALternatiuvelly, to use the object 'hca_heart_immune_download.h5ad', which notebook is correct?
# Thank you for reviewing and replying.

# First,  I replaced the 'hca_heart_global_ctl200422.h5ad' with the downloaded 'hca_heart_immune_download.h5ad' for 
# Line 104
